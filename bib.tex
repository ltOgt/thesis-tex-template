	The following offers a listing of all sources that were used to write this thesis.

	Sources are ordered in accordance to the relative position of where they were first referenced in the text.
	Sources are furthermore grouped by the chapter in which they were first referenced.
	This means that a source which was referenced in a later chapter, but has also been referenced in a preceeding one, will not be listed under the later chapter, but instead only under the first.
